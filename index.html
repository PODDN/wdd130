            <p>Ukraine is a large European country, known for its rich history, culture and natural beauty. Located in the east of Europe, it has access to the Black Sea and borders seven countries. Ukraine is famous for its fertile lands, architectural monuments such as the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra and Sophia Cathedral, as well as the traditions and hospitality of its people. The capital of Ukraine is Kyiv, one of the oldest cities in Europe, which has damaged ancient traditions and modern development.</p>
