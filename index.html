            <p>Ukraine is a large European country, known for its rich history, culture, and natural beauty. Located in the east of Europe, it has access to the Black Sea and borders seven countries. Ukraine is famous for its fertile lands, architectural monuments such as the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra and Sophia Cathedral, as well as the traditions and hospitality of its people. The capital of Ukraine is Kyiv, one of the oldest cities in Europe, which has damaged ancient traditions and modern development.</p>

                HELLO! I'm Denys Piddubnyi, a 21-year-old enthusiast from Kyiv, Ukraine, with a passion for chess, football, and movies. My love for chess sharpens my strategic thinking, while football keeps me active and energized. In my downtime, I enjoy diving into the world of movies, appreciating the art of storytelling and cinematography. Living in the vibrant city of Kyiv, I find inspiration in its rich culture and history.
